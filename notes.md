Zydavia: A True Escape

What is Zydavia?
Zydavia is an virtual Sex-Positive World, and so much more.
What Zydavia is first though is a co-op. Zydavia was dreamed up by Mystique Watson with community in mind, and we intend to keep it that way. 
Zydavia will be an open-source effort to create a world that kinksters, queers, LGBTQ+, and anyone else who desires a sexy, safe online experience can enjoy.
